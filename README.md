# RestaurantAccountingTools
Python Projects to fix and augment my Restaurant Accounting Workflow

Always been an Excel guru, but have realized it's a crutch, and problematic when deploying tools to others.

Am very early in my proper "dev journey," and am interested in ERP (Inventory Management, Journal Entries, Reporting, Payroll, Taxes, etc.) as well as Game Dev
for a more "personalized motivation" rather than just the professional one.

Primary Focuses at the momentL
  Port over all Excel tools and "workflow" into Python (while learning and growing with Python)
  Learn GD Script and Godot as primary Game Dev avenue
